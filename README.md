# Protein Sequence Visualiser

Data required for visualisation is attached as `P02787.fasta` and `omsssaresults.csv`.

This java program visualises a FASTA file along with its peptide sequences from an OMSSA file.

The distribution `.jar` file is found in the peptideVisualiser/dist folder. Running this `.jar` file will open up the GUI window where the user can load the files using the file menu.
